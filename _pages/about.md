Hi üëã, my name is **Yiqi Wang (ÁéãÊÄ°Áê™)**. I am a final year M.Sc. Landscape Architecture student at College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai. My advisor is Associate Prof. Dr. Nannan Dong.

I am currently applying for a Ph.D. for Fall 2025. My research interest includes **ecosystem services**, **landscape ecology**, and **spatial design and planning**. You can find my **CV** here: [YiqiWang's Curriculum Vitae](assets/CV_YiqiWang_11.27.pdf)

[A Multi Source Data-Based Method for Assessing Carbon Sequestration of Urban Parks from a Spatial‚ÄìTemporal Perspective: A Case Study of Shanghai Century Park](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13111914)

Peer-reviewed Journal | Land

**Yiqi Wang**, Jiao Yu, Weixuan Wei, Nannan Dong

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ In this paper, I established a spatial-temporal framework to assess the **carbon sequestration** capacity of large urban parks.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using remote sensing imagery and the random forest algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform (https://earthengine.google.com/), I performed biotope classifications and analyzed their temporal and spatial transitions.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Focusing on **Shanghai Century Park**, I estimated its carbon sequestration capacity from 2018 to 2023, exploring variation characteristics and driving factors, and proposing low-carbon design strategies for urban park management.

[Assessing Buffer Gradient Synergies: Comparing Objective and Subjective Evaluations of Urban Park Ecosystem Services in Century Park, Shanghai](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13111848)

Peer-reviewed Journal | Land

Weixuan Wei, **Yiqi Wang**, Qi Yan, Guanpeng Liu, Nannan Dong

- In this study, we integrated objective data and subjective perceptions of ecosystem services (ESs) in urban park planning, revealing that a 35 m buffer radius optimally aligns assessments for most ESs while emphasizing stakeholder-specific synergies to guide sustainable and wellbeing-centered urban green space design.

[Xuhui Runway Park Landscape Performance Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.31353/cs1821)

Peer-reviewed Report | Landscape Performance Series, Landscape Architecture Foundation

Nannan Dong, **Yiqi Wang**

- Through a combination of on-site and online investigations, I quantitatively evaluated six environmental, six social, and one economic benefit provided by Xuhui Runway Park, including carbon sequestration, stormwater management, biodiversity enhancement, and urban noise mitigation.
