Hi 👋, my name is **Yiqi Wang (王怡琪)**. I am a final year M.Sc. Landscape Architecture student at College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai. My advisor is Associate Prof. Dr. Nannan Dong.

I am currently applying for a Ph.D. for Fall 2025. My research interest includes ecosystem services, landscape ecology, landscape design and planning. You can find my **CV** here: [YiqiWang's Curriculum Vitae](assets/CV_YiqiWang_11.27.pdf)

[A Multi Source Data-Based Method for Assessing Carbon Sequestration of Urban Parks from a Spatial–Temporal Perspective: A Case Study of Shanghai Century Park](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13111914)

**Yiqi Wang**, Jiao Yu, Weixuan Wei, Nannan Dong
- In this paper, I established a spatial-temporal framework to assess the carbon sequestration capacity of large urban parks. Using remote sensing imagery and the random forest algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform, I performed biotope classifications and analyzed their temporal and spatial transitions. Focusing on Century Park, I estimated its carbon sequestration capacity from 2018 to 2023, exploring variation characteristics and driving factors, and proposing low-carbon design strategies for urban park management.
